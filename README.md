# knn_example
This is a hypothetical data set showing the potential of the KNN algorithm in both regression and Classification.

The data are made up of a hypothetical town where a person is looking to model how many dogs are walking at a given time so their socially shy dog can avoid others.
This is the regression example as the two columns are simply time and number of dogs walking.

The classification example is trying to figure out if an animal is a cat or a dog based on it's paw size, mass of the animal, and jump height. This data is also 
entirely made up just to show the potential of knn.

The code is in Python and R.
